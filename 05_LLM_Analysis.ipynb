    "Our Hopper architecture continues to see incredible adoption. H100 demand remains extremely \n",
    "strong, and we're ramping production of our next-generation Blackwell platform. We expect \n",
    "Blackwell to generate significant revenue in the second half of fiscal 2025.\n",

    "Gaming revenue was $2.9 billion, up 56% year-over-year, driven by GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs. \n",
    "Our RTX technology is becoming the standard for PC gaming and content creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colette Kress, CFO:\n",
    "Gross margin for the quarter was 76%, reflecting strong pricing in data center products. \n",
    "We expect gross margins to remain in the mid-70s percent range for the next several quarters. \n",
    "Operating expenses were $3.2 billion, up 26% year-over-year as we invest in research and \n",
    "development for our AI platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Q1 FY2025, we expect revenue of approximately $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We continue \n",

    "already several billion dollars.\n",

    "  Jensen: We have a significant moat through our CUDA software ecosystem. Over 4 million \n",

    "  the entire software stack that has been built over 15 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyst: What about China revenue impact from export controls?\n",
    "  Colette: China data center revenue was significant in prior years. The export controls \n",
    "  have reduced our addressable market in China. However, demand from other regions has more \n",
    "  than offset this impact. We are developing compliant products for the China market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyst: How should we think about capital allocation?\n",
    "  Colette: We returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends this \n",

Both AMD and NVDA have higher revenue growth rates compared to Intel, but their P/E ratios and forward P/E ratios are lower than Intel, indicating a lower price for the same growth. However, when comparing AMD and NVDA, NVDA is more expensive in terms of P/E and forward P/E ratios, but it has a significantly higher revenue growth rate.\n",

      "2. MOMENTUM: AMD and NVDA have shown stronger business trajectories than Intel. Both AMD and NVDA have higher revenue growth rates and have outperformed Intel in terms of stock price appreciation over the past year. AMD has shown particularly strong momentum, with a 52-week high that is more than triple its 52-week low, compared to NVDA's 52-week high that is more than double its 52-week low.\n",

      "3. RISK/REWARD: AMD offers a better asymmetric setup due to its lower price and higher growth potential compared to NVDA. While NVDA's higher price and lower growth rate make it riskier, AMD's lower price and higher growth rate offer a potentially higher reward if the growth continues. Intel, on the other hand, presents a lower risk due to its lower price and negative revenue growth, but the potential reward is limited due to its stagnant growth.\n",

AMD is the most attractive due to its strong momentum, high growth potential, and lower price. NVDA is the second most attractive due to its high growth potential but higher price. Intel is the least attractive due to its stagnant growth and lower price.\n"
